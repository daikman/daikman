ðŸ‘‹ Hello! ðŸ˜Š

I write code for my job [@Public Health Scotland](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland) and also for fun sometimes. Sometimes both!

I help maintain the [Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/) platform, and work to improve (and/or automate) the Open Data systems at Public Health Scotland.
Most of the code I write for my job is actually in a top secret private repo, so you can't see it, sorry!
But the non-top-secret stuff is here for all to see. Don't judge me ðŸ‘€
